# 1/100 simple webhook consumer
This project is a simple webhook consumer built with Java, Spring Boot, and Temporal. It demonstrates how to use Temporal workflows to process and manage webhook events reliably.

## Features
- Receives webhook events via REST API
- Processes events through Temporal workflows
- Idempotency check through Temporal by setting unique workflowId per event
- Provides durable execution with automatic retries
- Saves webhook data to AWS Dynamodb
- Handles event history and status tracking via Temporal

## Technologies
- Java
- Spring Boot
- Temporal
- DynamoDB (for event storage)
- Maven

## Running locally:
```
# setup temporal server:
git clone https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose.git
cd docker-compose
docker-compose up

# run this app:
git clone https://github.com/michael-oswald/100-temporal-apps.git
cd 100-apps/app-1-webhook-consumer
./mvnw spring-boot:run

# dynamodb:
You'll need to run a local dynamodb, or create a dynamodb table in your AWS account and set the table name as example-webhooks.

# testing with curl:
curl --location 'localhost:8081/api/webhook' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "webhookId":"53698243-0425-4a76-9492-909b3cb34c01",
    "data":"all kinds of important data",
    "createdAt":"2025-04-30T12:51:44.837Z"
}'
```
